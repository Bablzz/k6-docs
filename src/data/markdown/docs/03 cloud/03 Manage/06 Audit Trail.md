## What is an Audit trail
An audit trail provides a chronological list of system events and user activities. This is a great way
for organization owners to keep an eye on operations being performed by their users and
to help trace specific events.

## Reconstructing Events
By reading through the audit trail you can start to piece together how a series 
of events perhaps led to a test being deleted, a member losing access to a project, subscription 
or billing settings being altered, and much more.

## Threat Detection
Perhaps you've noticed suspicious activity and you want to rule out the possibility 
something or someone has gained unauthorized access to your organization. You can scan 
the audit trail for abnormalities and even check the IP addresses correlate to what you have 
registered for your users.
